This is the syllabus and course material for
[MigraCode Barcelona](https://migracode.openculturalcenter.org/). It is based on the syllabus from [CodeYourFuture](https://codeyourfuture.io) and other resources.

During the course you will learn a technology stack that helps you build
anything from a simple website to a powerful database-driven web application or
even a mobile app!

The six-months course contains:

* HTML/CSS
* Core JavaScript
* Backend development using [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)
* Modern front-end development with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)

Weâ€™ll complement the training with workshops on modern software methodologies
and job interview practices, etc.
