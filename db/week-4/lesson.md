## Node Recap

Javascript has evolved from the browser to be used in the backend. It does not need a framework as we saw in [week-13](../week-13/lesson.md), however a framework like Express allows us to develop faster.

### Documentation

When you are working with frameworks it is always helpful to use their documentation.

- [Express Documentation](https://expressjs.com)
- [Node.js Documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html)

### Middleware

Middleware allow us to process requests to add functionalities that are not built in to Express, for example logging, authentication, etc.

> - Express Documentation: [Using Middleware](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html)
> - Video: [body-parser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlybue_yMQ) which makes it easier to work with POST requests and forms.

## Authentication

Routing refers to how an applicationâ€™s endpoints (URIs) respond to the client requests. These are configured differently for each framework, and can range from basic configuration to very extensive for more complex use cases.

Simple example

```js
app.get("/", function (request, response) {
  res.send("hello world");
});
```

Sometimes you need to add user functionality for your website. Example using `express-session` for authentication

```js
app.get('/', (request, response) => {
    if (request.session.loggedin) {
        response.send('Welcome back, ' + request.session.username + '!');
    } else {
        response.send('Please login to view this page!');
    }
    response.end();
});
```

To understand express-session, we need to know first, what is a session and a cookie?

- Session: is a single interval of time in which the user is authenticated.
- Cookie: are used to collect identifying information about the user, such as Web surfing behavior or user preferences for a specific Web site, also are used to store user sessions. Depending on the management, Cookies are stored during a specified period of time, in the browser or in the hard drive

> - Read the [Basics on Authentication](https://www.sohamkamani.com/blog/2017/01/08/web-security-session-cookies/) to understand better the process.

**Exercise:** Create a server using express-session by following the next [steps](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/session-management-using-express-session-module-in-node-js/)

> - Example: [express-session-example](https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/storing-user-sessions-on-the-server-with-express-session-422fe11bc500)
> - Documentation: [express-session](http://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/session.html)

## Security

When you take your website to production there is a whole range of things to consider.

![HTTP vs HTTPS](../assets/http-vs-https.png)

Node has built in support for HTTPS, and once you have your own certificates you can use this feature. However sometimes when you deploy to `cloud` Platform Platform as a Service (PaaS) providers such as Heroku, they provide SSL and configure it for you automatically.

> - Read: [Node: HTTPS](https://nodejs.org/api/https.html)
> - Read/Watch: [What is an SSL Certificate?](https://www.globalsign.com/en/ssl-information-center/what-is-an-ssl-certificate/)
> - Read: [Heroku SSL](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ssl)

## Best Practices

Express have their own recommended [best practices page](https://expressjs.com/en/advanced/best-practice-performance.html)

### REST

REST is a convention of how to design your API, whether it is for your own frontend, or other frontends and clients.
