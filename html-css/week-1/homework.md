# Homework

### Readings and games:

- Advanced CSS Selectors
    - Read this about [CSS Selectors](http://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/complex-selectors/)
    - Play this [game](https://flukeout.github.io/) and complete it:
- HTML Reading
    - Read this page on [HTML syntax](https://marksheet.io/html-syntax.html)

### Delivery:

- Bikes-for-refugees
    - The aim of the exercise is for your webpage to look like [this](https://codeyourfuture.github.io/syllabus-london/html-css/assets/screenshot-complete.png) 
    - Open the `index.html` file in your browser, and compare it to the image of the final result. What's different?
    - Use semantic markup: Where necessary, replace the `<div>`s with semantic HTML tags. This will not render differently in the browser, but it's good practice to use semantic markup when you can!
    - Fix the broken images: Some of the links to images are broken. The images you need are in the `images` folder - please replace any broken image links with the correct paths.
    - Style buttons: There are 3 buttons on the page. They need to be styled correctly - remember, re-use styles as much as possible by using classes.
    - Fix the positioning: Use Flexbox to move elements around so they are positioned correctly
